### üìÑ **Project Title:**

**C-PlagAST: AST-CC Based Plagiarism Detection Tool for C Code**

---

### üìù **Project Description:**

**C-PlagAST** is an advanced plagiarism detection tool specifically designed for analyzing C source code. It leverages the **AST-CC (Abstract Syntax Tree ‚Äì Consistent Comparison)** algorithm to identify structural similarities between code files, making it robust against superficial changes such as variable renaming, formatting variations, and reordering of functions or declarations.

Unlike traditional text-based comparison tools, C-PlagAST parses source code into **abstract syntax trees**, applies a series of **normalization techniques** (such as dead code elimination, function and declaration reordering, and prototype removal), and then generates structural hashes or similarity scores to evaluate the likelihood of plagiarism.

This tool is intended for use in academic and professional environments where accurate and structure-aware code plagiarism detection is essential.
